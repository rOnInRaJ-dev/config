# When A PIP window is created (by switching tabs in Arc), it has ID 77477. It is then moved, and resized.
# However, When the window is clicked on: yabai creates a new window with different ID, at the bottom left corner, with size (10x10);

# Observations:
# 1. When the PIP window is created, an event signal is not created. instead it only calls the `window_manager_create_and_add_window` function.
# 2. When the PIP window is created, the PIP window is not focused.
# 3. When the PIP window is clicked on, a new window is created at the bottom left corner, with size (10x10), and the mouse goes there.
# 4. No EVENT_HANDLER_WINDOW_CREATED event is created ever
# 5. THE initial PIP window has dynamic id. the window created when clicking on PIP, has static id of 75447
# 6. The corrupt window, id destroyed when changing focus, to another application. and is created again when clicking on PIP window with the same id.

# testing it to change focus to the PIP window
 # yabai -m signal --add event=window_focused app="Arc" title="^$" \
 #   action="echo 'window is focused on: focus on recent' && yabai -m query --windows --space 3"

# yabai -m rule --add app="^Arc$" subrole="AXSystemDialog" manage=off


# TEST IF THIS WORKS:
#   Change this line in (application.c/line:7) from: 
    # if (CFEqual(notification, kAXCreatedNotification)) {
    # to:
    # if (CFEqual(notification, kAXWindowCreatedNotification)) {
# This will create the observer, only when a window is created, and not any UI element.
# This works for the Arc PIP window, but still need to check if it works for other apps.


# Ok ^ doesnt workk
# new solution, if the new thing created is AXSystemDialog, then dont create a new yabai window
# Edited `Appilcation.c` file, to filter the AXSystemDialog, and not create a new yabai window for it.
# 
# 1. renamed the official yabain binary to 'yabai_olc'
# 2. copied the new yabai binary from ./src/yabai/bin/ to /opt/homebrew/Cellar/yabai/7.1.2/bin/
# 3. If there is a new update, then I may or may not have to do this again.
